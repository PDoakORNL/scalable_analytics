# Python analytics using ORNL CADES Birthright Cloud

Please see the following self-help guides on:
* [Basic setup and operation of the python analytics virtual machine](python_analytics_server.md)
* [Transferring files between your local and virtual machines](sftp.md)
* [Adding additional storage volumes for your data](mount_drive.md)
* [Configuring ssh aliases](ssh_alias.md)

Note that I have put these self-help guides together adapting / using other tutorials I found online. I have linked to these tutorials wherever I used them in case you need additional information. 

If you have any tutorials that may benefit others, please feel free to add them here.
