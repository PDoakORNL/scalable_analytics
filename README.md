Please see the following tutorials on:
* [basic setup and operation of the python analytics virtual machine](python_analytics_server.md)
* [Transferring files between your local and virtual machines](sftp.md)

Note that I have put these tutorials together adapting / using other tutorials I found online. I have linked to these tutorials wherever I used them in case you need additional information.
