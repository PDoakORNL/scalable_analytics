This is applicable for **MacOS ONLY**

The Mac `Terminal` application comes with utilities that simplify the ssh process with a graphical interface. If you are comfortable with the command line and do not mind typing ssh / sftp commands you do not need to follow the following steps.

## Simply accessing the VM
1.  Open the `Terminal` app
2.  Go to `Shell` â†’ `New Remote Connection`
3.  Click on the `+` icon under the right-hand column (`Server`).
4.  Type the address of your instance like `cades@172.22.3.50` into the pop up window as shown in the image below
5.  Click `OK`.

6.  You should see a new entry in the `Server` column.

7. You can now click on the ``Connect`` button to connect to your VM
8. You can use the same entries for other services such as  `Secure File Transfer` ([sftp](./sftp.md)).
  
## Tunneling to Remote Server
The former application does not make a particularly compelling case for setting up the GUI shortcut. 
However, it is very handy for setting up the necessary SSH tunnels to your VM (already) running a Jupyter server. See [this page](./tunnelling_remote_server.md#mac-setup) for instructions.
